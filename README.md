### Aim

**Phase 1** of the project is to visualise supplier sales and determine a metric to calculate how carbon friendly a supplier is. To tackle this we used carbon ratings as a metric. Carbon Ratings and Carbon Footprint are calculated based on certain on certain [factors](https://justenergy.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-carbon-footprint/). Also we have provided an in-depth visualisation of supplier sales based on Region, Market, and Cities.
